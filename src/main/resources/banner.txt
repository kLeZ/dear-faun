* Dear Faun

Dear Faun is a Java-based text role playing game.

I will try to develop this game writing with all the patterns and best practices
I've learnt during years of work and study. I hope you want to play with it when
it is completed, and I hope you will file me any issue or improvement you find
out during this game.
